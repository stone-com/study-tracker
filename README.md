# Study Tracker Timeclock

## About
This is a simple MERN timeclock app made for tracking my own hours of studying.
Users are able to create an account, and then 'clock in' and 'clock out'.
All 'Shifts" or study sessions will be displayed with total hours worked/studied, as well as comments if the user chooses to add. 

## Future plans
Sort data by month / week
